# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via GitHub Issues
with Roger Frybarger before making a change. Roger is open to, and encourages code quality improvements
as well as feature suggestions!

Please note that we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with this project.

## Some Notes on Pull Requests

1. At this point because of the small size of this project, all pull requests must be signed off by the
   current project maintainer, (Roger Frybarger), who will also be responsible for merging the pull 
   request.
   
2. Also please note that drastic changes to the user interface are generally not welcome. You are welcome
   to fork the project, re-name it and make the changes you desire in your version, but please take a
   lesson from Windows 8. People don't like drastic interface changes. Furthermore, we have intentionally
   allowed for expandability via the 'Other...' options in the applicable dropdowns. Thus, new tools can
   be added so long as they are added in these areas.
   
3. It is assumed that you have read the README.md file and adhered to the eslint code quality standards
   as explained in that file. If you find a need to make an exception to these standards, be prepared to
   make a compelling case for why such an exception is needed.

## Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team via the feedback section of our website,
(www.rogersmathwhiteboard.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated 
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with
regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement
policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
