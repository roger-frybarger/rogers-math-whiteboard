Note that you can probably search for this program on the Google Chrome
Web Store and install it from there. If that doesn't work, or you wish
to build the program from its source code, do the following:

1. Install Google Chrome or Chromium vesrion 51 or above if you do not
   already have it. (This step is critical. The rest of this guide will
   not work unless you have Google Chrome or Chromium version 51 or above
   installed on your system and working). If you wish to check what
   version of Chrome you have installed, open up Chrome or Chromium and
   go to chrome://help That should tell you what version you have
   installed. 

2. Extract the files from the zip file to a location of your choosing,
   making sure to keep the directory structure of the original zip file.

3. Open up Google Chrome or Chromium and go to chrome://extensions

4. Click the "Developer mode" checkbox if it is not already checked.

5. Click "Load unpacked extension"

6. Browse to the folder that you extracted the zip file into, and select
   the folder named "RMW_vxx-xx-xx-xx" where the x's are the applicable
   version numbers.

7. Click "Open" to load the extension into Chrome or Chromium.

8. To run it, simply click "Launch" underneath its name & description.
   You can also go to chrome://apps, (or just click the "Apps" button),
   and click its entry. If you wish to debug it, you can open an Inspect
   view in its entry on the chrome://extensions page while it is running.
