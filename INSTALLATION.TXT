Here are the basic steps for getting Roger’s Math Whiteboard installed onto your computer for development purposes:
1. Clone this repository into a folder of your choosing on your local machine.
2. Obtain the Electron framework version 1.4.13
3. Open the app using the Electron Framework.

There are two different ways to obtain & use the Electron framework:

Method 1: Installing Electron globally:
On Ubuntu-based machines you should be able to simply run the following commands in order:
1. sudo apt-get update
2. sudo apt-get upgrade
3. sudo apt-get install nodejs
4. sudo apt-get install npm
5. sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
6. sudo npm install electron@1.4.13 -g
Note: Wait for that last command to complete! It can take a while.
From there, you can cd, (change directory) into the folder with the source code for Roger’s Math Whiteboard and run:
electron .
to start the application.

Method 2: Using the Binary:
Go to 
https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v1.4.13
and download the bianary version for your system. (It comes down as a zip file).
From there, extract it to a folder of your choosing on your machine and run the electron executable.
This should produce a window that says 'Drag your app here it run it.'
You can then drag the folder of source code onto the window to start the app.
